Tinkerforge-IMU-GPS
===================

Connects to Tinkerforge [IMU](http://www.tinkerforge.com/de/doc/Hardware/Bricks/IMU_Brick.html) and [GPS](http://www.tinkerforge.com/de/doc/Hardware/Bricklets/GPS.html) and writes Data to file without knowing their UDID.


Based on the [Tinkerforge Tutorial](http://www.tinkerforge.com/de/doc/Tutorials/Tutorial_Rugged/Tutorial.html#tutorial-rugged-approach), but without a Class.

* `GPSdump.csv` only, if Position is available (maybe not on your desk, you have to go outside) :)
* Start Logging with `python SecureConnect.py`
